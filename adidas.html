    <h1>about adidas</h1>
    <p>
      Adidas (stylized as adidas since 1949) is a German multinational
      corporation, founded and headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, that
      designs and manufactures shoes, clothing and accessories. It is the
      largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the
      world, after Nike. It is the holding company for the Adidas Group, which
      consists 8.33% stake of the football club Bayern München, and Runtastic,
      an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas's revenue for 2018 was
      listed at €21.915 billion. The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his
      mother's house; he was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under
      the name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory").
      Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for
      multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic
      footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to
      utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens
      to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following
      a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas
      and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's business rival. The
      three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the
      company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. The branding,
      which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for
      the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles of whiskey, became so successful
      that Dassler described Adidas as "The three stripes company".
